#  Auto Vectorizer / Loop Analyzer Clang Plugin

## Overview

This Clang frontend plugin implements comprehensive loop vectorization analysis using advanced compiler optimization techniques. The plugin provides mathematical modeling including polyhedral analysis, data dependence theory, cost modeling, and automatic code transformation.

## Core Architecture

The plugin operates in two analysis modes:
- **Basic Analysis**: Pattern-based vectorization checking with clear diagnostics
- **Advanced Analysis**: Mathematical optimization with polyhedral theory and automatic transformation
